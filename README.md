# Auction Bot
A bot made for fictional auctions in discord, mainly used to expand my knowledge about the process of making a discord application

# Building
Building this requires the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html) library to work, follow the instructions there to install it.
From there you just need to run the program by using `python3 main.py` if you're on linux or `python main.py` if you're on Windows.
